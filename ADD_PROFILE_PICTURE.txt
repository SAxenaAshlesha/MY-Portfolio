HOW TO ADD YOUR PROFILE PICTURE
================================

Your profile picture from the image you shared needs to be saved properly.

STEPS:
------

1. LOCATE YOUR PHOTO
   - Find the green dress photo you want to use
   - It should be saved somewhere on your computer

2. COPY THE PHOTO
   - Copy your photo file
   - Navigate to this folder:
     C:\Users\ashle\OneDrive\Documents\portfolio\CascadeProjects\personal-website\
   
3. PASTE AND RENAME
   - Paste your photo in the folder
   - Rename it to exactly: profile.jpg
   - Delete the old empty profile.jpg file first

4. VERIFY
   - Open index.html in your browser
   - Your photo should now appear in the About Me section!

ALTERNATIVE METHOD:
------------------
If you have the image file path, you can also:
1. Right-click on your photo
2. Select "Copy"
3. Go to the personal-website folder
4. Right-click and "Paste"
5. Rename to "profile.jpg"

The website is already configured to display profile.jpg automatically!

IMPORTANT NOTES:
---------------
- File must be named exactly: profile.jpg (lowercase)
- Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png
- Recommended size: 300x300 pixels or larger
- The image will be automatically cropped to a circle

After adding your photo, you're ready to deploy!
See QUICK_START.md for deployment instructions.
